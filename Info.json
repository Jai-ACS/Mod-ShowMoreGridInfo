Enhances the Grid Info displayed in the game. The enhanced Grid Info shows the following information of the selected tile:\r\n1. Qi value\r\n2. Current and maximum Gather Qi values (see next section)\r\n3. Terrain & Flooring\r\n4. Fertility (with numeric value)\r\n5. Attractiveness (with numeric value)\r\n6. Light (with numeric value)\r\n\r\n※Maximum Gather Qi is determined by adding all Qi Gather objects within effective range on the tile. Qi will gradually gather on the tile over 5 days, increasing the total tile Qi value. The gathered Qi will reset to 0 whenever any Qi Gather item is placed or removed, changing the maximum Gather Qi value on the tile. The Qi will reach maximum again after 5 days.\r\n\r\n※When the Feng Shui Vision is activated, the Grid Info changes to display Qi value, Gather Qi values and the Elemental Composition (with values) of the tile.\r\n\r\n※Information of unexplored grids/tiles can also be shown with this mod.",
